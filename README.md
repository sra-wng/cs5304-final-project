#### Fall 2020 CS5304 Data Science in the Wild Final Project 

*Description* 

Goal: Utilize data pipelines, cleaning, and data mining and ML algorithms to answer/make a business decision by analyzing an existing large dataset. 

My team chose to explore [2017-2019 OSMI Mental Health in Tech](https://osmihelp.org/research) survey data. Our goal was to determine whether we could predict if tech company employees felt comfortable discussing mental health with their direct supervisor by training and comparing the performance of Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM classification models. We also performed natural language processing on text response data using count vectorization to gain additional insights.
